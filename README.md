# weather1
Weather app to print the weather of the current city.

There are 2 files, both of which follow the same logic. Only one of them is being tested. weather.py takes console input, and weathertest.py has a constant input that is assigned in the file itself, to enable easier testing. 
So the file being tested is weathertest.py.
For actual usage, use weather.py

You get the option to either locate the user through their ip adddress, or let them enter a city name
